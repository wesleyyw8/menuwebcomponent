# menuwebcomponent

On app folder there's the logic.js and index.html and two instances of the accordion.  
It runs on localhost setted up by grunt, it uses jshint in order to force me to not commit sintaxe mistakes. 
It doesnt use scss because the application is too small for that.  
It has been written with es6  
It has animation  
Max width relies on its parents container.  (check index.html)
There's no max height  
It is possible to initialise more than one instance of the accordion  



npm install  
npm start
